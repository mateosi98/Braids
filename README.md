# Braids
Untangling braids with Supervised Learning

  1. Create a database of braids and labels corresponding to the last move that was taken to obtain that braid (create_tree.py)
  2. Train an MLP NN to predict this single-label multi-class problem (Lara.py)
  3. Use several algorithms to consider the invesrse of the predicted action (Una.py)

This work was made by Alexei Lisitsa (University of Liverpool), Alexei Vernitski (University of Essex) and Mateo Salles (University of Essex)
